is thumbnail cache in large for episode 7 offseason
cargo install --path

 --TODO---
#DONE if its a png allow it to show aswell also let it just load everything tbh
I want the pictures to be better quality because they are so dusty, i wonder how fast gstreamer thumbnaisl are
--##DONEi want it to indicate where its a dir or not
--i want it so that you can turn on like showing the dircs /showing the files, i should proabbly
recreate the way things are shows on the screen, the struct would need to hold file properties aswell 
-- that needs to be a toggle and it doesnt work for the first thing, also i should have an Enum which would decide
what to show, then that enum could decide on what to display,
-- also i need to add a search but the num should come first IMO


wq
---ISSUES
//#DONEIndexs dont update, so when you clear the screen i didnt clear the index so they didnt match up somewhere 



// if i use the command for a dir the default should be as if you opened it in that directory


// run in target to replace one in cargo path
 mv kousgrep /home/koushikk/.cargo/bin
